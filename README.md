# HoustonHelps

HoustonHelps is a web application developed for the 2017 Houston Hackathon. 

The main premise of HoustonHelps is to link members of the Houston community who unfortunately are not able to afford basic necesseties with CraigsList donors who are ready to help. Using a custom built API, HH scrapes all items within a close proximity of the user that are free. Additionally, HH provides a hard-lined screening process which verifies all donors to ensure safety in all transactions.
